## DSR Remote Part Time Interview

Start interview with Behavior Questions:

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. How is your capstone project going? Tell us a bit about it.
3. Does this schedule seem like something you could do?
   1. Tues/Thursday evening classes 6-8
   2. Saturday from 9 - 2
   3. Office hours scattered throughout week
4. Lets say you answer a help desk ticket and the student is showing obvious signs of distress about a problem. How would you handle answering their question?


Work through the questions found in DSR_Techincal_interview.ipynb with interviewee sharing your screen. Leaving the last 15 minutes for questions from interviewee.
