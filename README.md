## DSR Remote Part Time Interview

Start interview with Behavior Questions:

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. How is your capstone project going? Tell us a bit about it.
3. Does this schedule seem like something you could do?
   1. Tues/Thursday evening classes 6-8
   2. Saturday from 9 - 2
   3. Office hours scattered throughout week
4. Lets say you answer a help desk ticket and the student is showing obvious signs of distress about a problem. How would you handle answering their question?
5. Imagine a student asks you about a question that you don't have an answer to, how would you handle that?
6. What were some aspects of the DSRs you worked with in your cohort that you appreciated?
